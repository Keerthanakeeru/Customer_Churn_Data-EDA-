Customer Churn Data – Python EDA Project

Project Overview:
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of customer churn data using Python’s exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The main goal is to uncover patterns and drivers behind customer attrition to inform data-driven retention strategies and enhance business performance.

Objectives:

Clean and preprocess raw customer datasets for high-quality analysis.

Explore and summarize key metrics: churn rate, tenure, service adoption, demographics, and payment behavior.

Identify influential features and correlations related to customer churn.

Visualize trends, segment-risk profiles, and the impact of various factors on retention.

Project Tasks:

Data cleaning and feature engineering using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

Statistical analysis and distribution checks to understand customer demographics and churn patterns.

Creation of interactive visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, histograms) with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Comparative analysis between churned and retained customers across various attributes (e.g., contract type, service usage).

Documentation of findings and actionable recommendations for improving customer retention.

Tools & Techniques:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflow and reporting

Outcome:
Delivered a robust, well-structured EDA workflow, providing actionable insights and visual reports that support targeted retention strategies and future predictive modeling efforts. The approach is scalable and reusable for continuous business analysis.
